# Skin-care

This project showcases a cutting-edge skin 
care recommender system that is made to offer 
customised skincare advice depending on each person's 
skin type, problems, and preferences.

The system analyses 
user-specific data, such as skin features, issues with skin 
care, and preferences, by using sophisticated machine 
learning algorithms.

The system creates customised 
recommendations to maximise the effectiveness of 
skincare routines by combining user-provided data with 
a thorough skincare product database and the diagnosis 
of the skin issues. 

The recommender system follows a 
rigorous approach, taking into account factors such as 
targeted skincare aims, significant impacts, and skin type. 
Since we have created the recommendation system to 
respond to changes in user preferences, deep learning 
techniques are used to continuously improve and modify 
the recommended diagnostic.

 CONCLUSION
The main objective of the project is to create a 
system that suggests skin care items to users based on their 
skin type, concerns, and issues.

The study suggests 
classifying skin types and identifying and categorizing skin 
issues using a variety of machine learning and deep learning 
algorithms.

When classifying skin types as either dry or oily, 
the CNN Model yields a recall value of 1.0, an accuracy of 
roughly 0.9166, and a precision value of 0.8366. The Yolo v8 
model was utilized to discover more skin issues.

Yolo v8 
model was employed for the other skin concerns detection. 
Thus, this composite architecture combines the outputs given 
by the models to recommend products that match the personâ€™s 
concerns. In summary the Skin Care Recommendation 
System project combines image classification, machine 
learning and user interface design to create a practical and 
effective tool for personalised recommendation
